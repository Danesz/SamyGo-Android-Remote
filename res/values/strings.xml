\n\nTo be able to control your TV, you have to run <a href="https://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/samygo/index.php?title=Content_Library_applications_list#Remote_LAN_Control"><b>Remote Lan Control</b></a> on your TV. How to do that is explained <a href="https://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/samygo/index.php?title=SamyGO_for_DUMMIES#Using_a_SamyGO_app">here</a>.
